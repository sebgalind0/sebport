    "I was born in Bolivia and started my first business at 12, organizing Yu-Gi-Oh card tournaments. Since then, I have lived on three continents, visited 17 countries, moved to the U.S. in 2015 as an F1 student, and founded 3 tech startups.",
  summary:
    "I am the father of one beautiful baby boy, the husband of a beautiful, supportive partner, and the founder and CEO of Jex. We are building the first AI agent to help international students in the U.S. get hired. As a former international student, I know the pain firsthand. The journey did not start here. Back in 2020, we launched a mobile app that grew to ~80k users in two years, started a staffing agency that reached $2M in revenue within one year, and invested in a few tech startups. Outside of work, I have a passion for quantum physics and exploring the nature of reality. ",
